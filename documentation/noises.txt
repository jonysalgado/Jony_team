NOISE IN RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM RCSSSERVER 15.4.0

====== Sense Body
1- Body Velocity Magnitude
	- Ranges from 0 to some random number between player_speed_max + player_speed_max_delta_min and  player_speed_max + player_speed_max_delta_max (these deltas are heterogeneous parameters).
	- Measured absolutely
	- Quantized with linear quantization function q*ceil(value/q), where q = 0.01.

2- Body Velocity Direction
	- Ranges from -180 to +180 degrees
	- Measured related to absolute neck angle(body angle + head angle)
	- Truncated to integer

3- Neck Angle
	- Ranges from -90 to +90 degrees
	- Measured related to body direction
	- Truncated to integer
	
4- PointTo Information
	1) Cycles untill movable(i.e. may send another pointto command)
		- No noise
	2) Cycles untill expires(i.e. pointto is automatically resetted)
		- No noise
	3) Distance between the pointed location and your current location
		- Quantized(rounding, not truncating) to 0.1 (+-0.05 garanteed error)
	4) Angle of pointed location related to your absolute neck angle
		- Quantized(rounding, not truncating) to 0.1 (+-0.05 garanteed error)
		- Value in range (-180, +180] degrees
	5) Pointto count(number of pointto command effectivated)
		- No noise
		
5- Focus Information
	May be "none" or:
	1) Focus side("l"/"r" for left/right)
		- No noise
	2) Focused player unum
		- No noise
	3) Focus count(number of focus effectivated)
		- No noise
		
6- Tackle Information
	1) Cycles untill player can tackle again(i.e. end frozen state)
		- No noise
	2) Tackle count(number of tackles effectivated)
		- No noise

7- Collision Information
	Informs if have collided with any object and the object types:
	Ball -> (ball)
	Player -> (player)
	Post -> (post)
	No collision -> none
	
======

====== Visual

Server distances before sent to the player are quantized by the following formula:

    D_obs = Quantize( exp( Quantize(log(D_real),quantize_step) ), 0.1 )

And Quantize is

    Quantize(d,q) = ceil(d/q)*q

For an intuitive look of how that looks graphically, refer to see_noise.m.
For moving objects, quantize_step = 0.1. For steady objects, quantize_step = 0.01.

The observed direction is rounded to the nearest integer and then truncated to int. This means it has +-0.5 garanteed error.
